# OPx
Project name: Plataform OPx

Description: Mobile and web platform for collaborative measuring peacebuilding. The Urban Peace Index proposed by the team OPC measures the many peaces from a bottom-up perspective. This platform enables intiatives of data generated by citizens for defining what peace is and analizing peacebuilding interventions.

The OPx platform design is structured by components and four different user roles. Web components are mainly for setting-up measuring projects. Mobile components are for implementing field works even in off-line conditions. Reports before, during and after a project were strutured on the business model classes. Four reference applications were integrated for enabling the OPC team process of measuring what peace is.
